As a bioinformatician I try to understand the chaotic and unstructured nature of life with something we have much more control over: computers. With a formal education in both Biology and Computer Science I can make the bridge between those fields. I have good understanding of mathematics, computer science, statistics and cellular biology and mostly interested in genetics, the code of life.
